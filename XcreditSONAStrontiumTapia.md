## **Take on SONA July 2025 of Pres. Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr.**
*by TAPIA, Reeva Emerille F. of 9-Strontium*

1. Two points from the SONA 2025 that I find interesting are the mentions of teachers receiving pay for teaching overload & overtime and the goal to give internet to 12000 public schools before the end of 2025.

2. One point that I found a little weird is Pres. BBM's statement on returning any bill not fully aligned with the national expenditure program.

### **REFLECTION**
After watching this year's SONA, I thought that the president made many promising remarks. These include the mention of more funding to establishments such as public hospitals or schools. Aside from this, I was also pleasantly surprised about the fact he talked about the government working together to solve the growing cases of missing persons. I would say these are most of my positive thoughts after watching the SONA.

Of course, there were things mentioned that I would have liked to be talked about more. This includes talks about flood control in the Philippines, especially with the recent typhoon. I would have hoped for more information regarding this, along with the building of more evacuation centers. Overall, there were some good things talked about, but also more projects I would have liked information on.

4. I have hope for the Philippines, but we can only see how it all turns out.
